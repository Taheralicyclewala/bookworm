1. 

created my own mysqld.cnf file:

[mysqld]
pid-file	            = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
socket		            = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
# Where the database files are stored inside the container
datadir		            = /var/lib/mysql

# My application special configuration
max_allowed_packet          = 32M
sql-mode                    = 'STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION'

# Accept connections from any IP address
bind-address	            = 0.0.0.0
---
created a custom mysql docker image.
---
FROM mysql:5.6

# Setup the custom configuration
ADD mysqld.cnf /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

2. 

After running the mysql-deployment

->Tried to move into mysq container using command.
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> bash

--> after moving into mysql container run this command to check the bind address
mysqld --verbose --help | grep bind-address

--> Try to login into the mysql with the root user & password or your user & password.
mysql -u <username> -p

3. 

Setting up the (MYSQL_ROOT_HOST : '%') env file in  mysql-deployment.
